# Propositions and Proofs

As we have mentioned, proofs and propositions are terms, with propositions as types. The universe `Prop` is the type of propositions.
To start with, it is best to ignore the difference between `Prop` and `Type` and treat them as the same.

A logical statement like `1 ≤ 2` is a proposition and has type `Prop`.
-/
#check 1 ≤ 2 -- Prop

-- The type `Prop` is itself a term of type `Type`.
#check Prop -- Type
#check Type -- Type 1

/-!
Proofs build on other proofs. We will see eventually what are the most basic proofs. For now, we will see some proofs and see how they can be used and combined.
-/
#check Nat.zero_le -- Nat → 0 ≤ n

#check Nat.le.refl -- ∀ {n : Nat}, n.le n

#check Nat.le.step -- ∀ {n m : Nat}, n ≤ m → n ≤ m.succ

/-!
The proposition `0 ≤ 2` is true and has proof `Nat.zero_le 2`.
-/
#check Nat.zero_le 2 -- 0 ≤ 2

/-!
The proposition `1 ≤ 3` is true and has proof `Nat.succ_le_succ (Nat.zero_le 2)`.
-/
#check Nat.succ_le_succ (Nat.zero_le 2) -- 1 ≤ 3

/-!
The notation `· ≤ ·` is for the `Nat.le` relation, which is defined inductively.
-/
#check Nat.le -- Nat → Nat → Prop

/-!
Two basic propositions are `False` and `True`. `False` is the proposition that is never true, and `True` is the proposition that is always true.
-/
#check False -- Prop
#check True -- Prop

/-!
We can combine propositions to make propositions:

* If `P` and `Q` are propositions, then `P ∧ Q` is the proposition "P and Q".
* If `P` and `Q` are propositions, then `P ∨ Q` is the proposition "P or Q".
* If `P` and `Q` are propositions, then `P → Q` is the proposition "if P then Q".
* If `P` is a proposition, then `¬ P` is the proposition "not P", which is `P → False`.

The key idea in *propositions as types* is that function application is exactly analogous to the logical rule of inference called *modus ponens*.
-/
def modus_ponens {P Q: Prop} (h₁ : P) (h₂ : P → Q) : Q :=
  h₂ h₁

/- We define a function `functionApplication` that applies a function to an argument. This is the same as modus ponens, but for arbitrary types rather than propositions.
The arguments are reversed to match the usual order of modus ponens.
-/
def functionApplication {α β : Type} (a: α) (f: α → β) : β :=
  f a

#check Nat.succ -- Nat → Nat
#eval functionApplication 1 Nat.succ -- 2

#check Nat.succ_le_succ -- ∀ {n m : Nat}, n ≤ m → n.succ ≤ m.succ

/-!
We apply modus-ponens with `P` being `0 ≤ 2` and `P → Q` being `Nat.succ_le_succ` applied to `0` and `2`. We need to use `@Nat.succ_le_succ` to specify the *implicit* arguments.
-/
#check @Nat.succ_le_succ 0 2 -- 0 ≤ 2 → 1 ≤ 3

#check modus_ponens (Nat.zero_le 2)
  (@Nat.succ_le_succ 0 2) -- 1 ≤ 3


/-!
Some proofs at *term level*.
-/
theorem one_le_three : 1 ≤ 3 :=
  Nat.le.step (Nat.le.step (Nat.le.refl ))

theorem two_le_five : 2 ≤ 5 :=
  Nat.le.step (Nat.le.step (Nat.le.step (Nat.le.refl)))

#check @Nat.succ_le_succ 0 2 (Nat.zero_le 2) -- 1 ≤ 3

theorem wrong_three_le_one (h : 2 ≤ 0) : 3 ≤ 1 :=
  Nat.succ_le_succ h

theorem n_le_n_plus_two (n : Nat) : n ≤ n + 2 :=
  Nat.le.step (Nat.le.step (Nat.le.refl))

def nat_le_n_plus_m (n m : Nat) : n ≤ n + m :=
  match m with
  | 0   => Nat.le.refl
  | m+1 => Nat.le.step (nat_le_n_plus_m n m)

## Proof Irrelevance

In Lean, any two proof terms of the same proposition are equal by definition. This is called *proof irrelevance*.
-/
theorem proof_irrelevance {P: Prop} (h₁ h₂: P) :
  h₁ = h₂ := rfl

/-!
## Universes

* Universes in Lean are called `Sort`s, they are `Sort 0`, `Sort 1`, etc.
* `Prop` is `Sort 0`.
* `Type` is `Sort 1`.
* `Type n` is `Sort n.succ`.
* Strictly speaking, the `n` here is a universe level, not a natural number.
