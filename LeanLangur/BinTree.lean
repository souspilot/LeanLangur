## Binary Trees

We consider an example of a data structure: binary trees. We define a binary tree datatype, a function to convert a binary tree to a list, and prove that membership in the tree corresponds to membership in the list.

This is our first example of defining an *inductive type*.

namespace langur -- starts a namespace to group the tutorial definitions

variable {α : Type}

/--
A simple binary tree where each leaf carries a value of type `α`,
and nodes represent branches with two subtrees.
-/
inductive BinTree (α : Type) where -- declares the inductive type or proposition `BinTree`
  | leaf : α → BinTree α -- declares another constructor or syntax alternative
  | node : BinTree α → BinTree α → BinTree α -- declares another constructor or syntax alternative
deriving Repr, Inhabited -- asks Lean to generate standard instances automatically

open BinTree -- opens names so constructors or helpers can be written unqualified

/--
Converts a binary tree to a list by performing an in-order traversal.

  | leaf x => [x] -- matches a leaf tree and returns `[x]`
  | node l r => -- matches an internal tree node and returns the concatenation of the left and right subtree lists

## Exercise: List to BinTree

Define a function `listToBinTree : List α → BinTree α` that converts a list to a binary tree (this is not unique). Then, prove that for any list `l` and element `x`, `x ∈ listToBinTree l` if and only if `x ∈ l`.

  | x :: xs =>
    match listToBinTree xs with
      | none => none
      | some t => some (node (leaf x) t)
